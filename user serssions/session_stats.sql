Session Statistics
Here are some scripts related to Session Statistics .

Session I/O By User
SESSION I/O BY USER NOTES:

•OS User - Name of the operating system user 
•PID - Process ID of the session 
•SID - Session ID of the session 
•Serial# - Serial# of the session 
•Physical Reads - Physical reads for the session 
•Block Gets - Block gets for the session 
•Consistent Gets - Consistent gets for the session 
•Block Changes - Block changes for the session 
•Consistent Changes - Consistent changes for the session 

select	nvl(ses.USERNAME,'ORACLE PROC') username,
	OSUSER os_user,
	PROCESS pid,
	ses.SID sid,
	SERIAL#,
	PHYSICAL_READS,
	BLOCK_GETS,
	CONSISTENT_GETS,
	BLOCK_CHANGES,
	CONSISTENT_CHANGES
from	v$session ses, 
	v$sess_io sio
where 	ses.SID = sio.SID
order 	by PHYSICAL_READS, ses.USERNAME

CPU Usage By Session
CPU USAGE BY SESSION NOTES:


•Username - Name of the user 
•SID - Session id 
•CPU Usage - CPU centiseconds used by this session (divide by 100 to get real CPU seconds) 

select 	nvl(ss.USERNAME,'ORACLE PROC') username,
	se.SID,
	VALUE cpu_usage
from 	v$session ss, 
	v$sesstat se, 
	v$statname sn
where  	se.STATISTIC# = sn.STATISTIC#
and  	NAME like '%CPU used by this session%'
and  	se.SID = ss.SID
order  	by VALUE desc

Resource Usage By User
RESOURCE USAGE BY USER NOTES:


•SID - Session ID 
•Username - Name of the user 
•Statistic - Name of the statistic 
•Value - Current value 

select 	ses.SID,
	nvl(ses.USERNAME,'ORACLE PROC') username,
	sn.NAME statistic,
	sest.VALUE
from 	v$session ses, 
	v$statname sn, 
	v$sesstat sest
where 	ses.SID = sest.SID
and 	sn.STATISTIC# = sest.STATISTIC#
and 	sest.VALUE is not null
and 	sest.VALUE != 0            
order 	by ses.USERNAME, ses.SID, sn.NAME

Session Stats By Session
SESSION STAT NOTES:


•Username - Name of the user 
•SID - Session ID 
•Statistic - Name of the statistic 
•Usage - Usage according to Oracle 

select  nvl(ss.USERNAME,'ORACLE PROC') username,
	se.SID,
	sn.NAME stastic,
	VALUE usage
from 	v$session ss, 
	v$sesstat se, 
	v$statname sn
where  	se.STATISTIC# = sn.STATISTIC#
and  	se.SID = ss.SID
and	se.VALUE > 0
order  	by sn.NAME, se.SID, se.VALUE desc

Cursor Usage By Session
CURSOR USAGE BY SESSION NOTES:


•Username - Name of the user 
•Recursive Calls - Total number of recursive calls 
•Opened Cursors - Total number of opened cursors 
•Current Cursors - Number of cursor currently in use 

select 	user_process username,
	"Recursive Calls",
	"Opened Cursors",
	"Current Cursors"
from  (
	select 	nvl(ss.USERNAME,'ORACLE PROC')||'('||se.sid||') ' user_process, 
			sum(decode(NAME,'recursive calls',value)) "Recursive Calls",
			sum(decode(NAME,'opened cursors cumulative',value)) "Opened Cursors",
			sum(decode(NAME,'opened cursors current',value)) "Current Cursors"
	from 	v$session ss, 
		v$sesstat se, 
		v$statname sn
	where 	se.STATISTIC# = sn.STATISTIC#
	and 	(NAME  like '%opened cursors current%'
	or 	 NAME  like '%recursive calls%'
	or 	 NAME  like '%opened cursors cumulative%')
	and 	se.SID = ss.SID
	and 	ss.USERNAME is not null
	group 	by nvl(ss.USERNAME,'ORACLE PROC')||'('||se.SID||') '
)
orasnap_user_cursors
order 	by USER_PROCESS,"Recursive Calls"

User Hit Ratios
USER HIT RATIO NOTES:


•Username - Name of the user 
•Consistent Gets - The number of accesses made to the block buffer to retrieve data in a consistent mode. 
•DB Blk Gets - The number of blocks accessed via single block gets (i.e. not through the consistent get mechanism). 
•Physical Reads - The cumulative number of blocks read from disk. 

•Logical reads are the sum of consistent gets and db block gets. 
•The db block gets statistic value is incremented when a block is read for update and when segment header blocks are accessed. 
•Hit ratio should be > 90% 

select	USERNAME,
	CONSISTENT_GETS,
        BLOCK_GETS,
        PHYSICAL_READS,
        ((CONSISTENT_GETS+BLOCK_GETS-PHYSICAL_READS) / (CONSISTENT_GETS+BLOCK_GETS)) Ratio
from 	v$session, v$sess_io
where 	v$session.SID = v$sess_io.SID
and 	(CONSISTENT_GETS+BLOCK_GETS) > 0
and 	USERNAME is not null
order	by ((CONSISTENT_GETS+BLOCK_GETS-PHYSICAL_READS) / (CONSISTENT_GETS+BLOCK_GETS))
